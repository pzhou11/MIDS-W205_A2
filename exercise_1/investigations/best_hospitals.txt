To answer the question of the best hospitals for high-quality care, I took a look at how the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and US News typically rank the best hospitals. What I've noticed is that they praise hospitals for being the great at certain specialities but don't really penalize hospitals for being bad at certain specialties. This makes sense to me because you usually go to a hospital for one or two specific procedures and not every kind of procedure so this method will allow you to find the best hospitals for the procedures you require. Therefore best hospitals in my ranking are based on hospitals that are the great at a wide variety of procedures without considering their areas of weakness.

For this question I chose to use the hvbp_hcahps_11_10_2016, HCAHPS - Hospital, Readmissions and Deaths - Hospital, and Complications - Hospital files. I chose these file because these are generally the criteria used by CMS when they are calculating how much to pay a facility for a certain procedure that is performed on a patient. On a basic level, Medicare payment is the severity of the diagnosis on the patient plus or minus value-based purchasing (VBP) and readmission reduction program (RRP). VBP and RRP are based on HCAHPS and the level of care for a patient. They can be either a bonus amount given to the hospitals with the best levels of care and patient satisfaction or it can be looked as a fee to the hospitals that are below average. RRP is based on the readmissions and deaths. VBP is based on the HCAHPS survey and clinical process of care measures which include complications. To calculate the scores for both these measures, Medicare sets baseline rates, which are typically around the average for hospitals nationwide, and gives the hospital points for going above that baseline. This method, doesn't actual penalize you for being bad in certain categories, but rather rewards you for being exceptionally good at certain ones. CMS also rewards the hospitals if they are improving over their past performances, but I chose to ignore that for this question because we are looking for the best hospitals, not the hospitals that improved the most.

I only included hospitals with more than 300 surveys and greater than a 20% response rate from the HCAHPS - Hospital file. 300 is typically the number CMS sets as the minimum standard a hospital must have. Any less and the hospital needs to explain to CMS why they have so little and provide more documentation.
From the complications file, I took only hospitals with greater than or equal to 100 cases in the denominator and removed the PSI_8 measure since every hospital had a score 0.6 so the measure didn't make much sense. I next only took the hospitals that had 7 or more of the remaining 10 measures.
From the readmissions file, I took only hospitals with greater than or equal to 50 cases in the denominator and included only hospitals that had 10 or more of the 14 measures.
Then I only took the hospitals that exists in all 3 files.

This selection of data will allow us to look at hospitals that have sufficient amount of cases to where the data won't be skewed by noise and gives us hospitals that perform a wide range of procedures.

From there I gave each hospital scores based on their ranks so that I could compare across the 3 different datasets. Ranking them allowed me to assign numbers to all 3 datasets and add them together since they are now in the same terms. 
I ranked the HCAHPS based on the overall performance score from the hvbp_hcahps_11_10_2016 file. I ranked complications and readmissions based on the number of measures the hospital had that were better than the national rate.

This lead me to the following top 10 hospitals:

030103	MAYO CLINIC HOSPITAL	4.0	2	6	4
240010	MAYO CLINIC HOSPITAL ROCHESTER	8.0	14	6	4
100151	MAYO CLINIC	16.3	6	39	4
370215	OKLAHOMA HEART HOSPITAL, LLC	21.0	1	21	41
360180	CLEVELAND CLINIC	42.3	38	85	4
450358	METHODIST HOSPITAL,THE	46.3	92	6	41
420087	ROPER HOSPITAL	46.3	50	85	4
220071	MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL	54.0	36	85	41
520049	BELLIN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL	58.3	49	85	41
450610	MEMORIAL HERMANN MEMORIAL CITY MEDICAL CENTER	59.3	153	21	4

The 3rd column is the average rank across the 3 measures. The 4th through 6th columns are the HCAHPS rank, readmissions rank, and complications rank respectively where the lower the number the better.

This confirms that this method was a good way to approach this question. The Mayo Clinics, Cleveland Clinic, and Massachusetts General Hospital are consistently considered to be a part of the top 5 hospitals in the country. Hospitals like Oklahoma Heart, Methodist, and Memorial Hermann are always ranked as top regional hospitals as well.
