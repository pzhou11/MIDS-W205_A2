I came up with the states with the highest quality care using a similar criteria that I used previously to find the best hospitals. There were 1389 hospitals that met my criteria previous. Using that, I chose to look at the ratio of top 10% of hospitals to the total amount of hospitals statewide. Therefore the states with the highest quality of care are the states where you have more of a chance of going to a higher quality hospital in that state. Using that criteria gave me the following top 10 states:

HI	3	2	0.67
UT	7	3	0.43
ME	8	2	0.25
RI	4	1	0.25
WI	32	7	0.22
MS	10	2	0.2
MN	17	3	0.18
NH	11	2	0.18
CA	108	17	0.16
MI	55	8	0.15

This tell me that 2 out of the 3 hospitals in Hawaii that met my previous criteria are of high quality care. Hawaii, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and California all exist in the top 10 in the US News best states for healthcare. 8 out of my top 10 appear in their 15.
