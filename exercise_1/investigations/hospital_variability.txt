The files I chose to use to find the procedures with greatest variability are the readmissions and complications files. I chose these because these represent the wide variety of procedures that hospital sees. By taking the standard deviation of the measures in these files, we can compare the procedures that have the largest variability in each of these files.

The first file I looked at was readmissions and mortality rates. The top five procedures with the largest variability are:
Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Mortality Rate    2.1                                     
Death rate for stroke patients	1.66
Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Readmission Rate	1.5
Heart failure (HF) 30-Day Mortality Rate	1.46
Pneumonia (PN) 30-Day Readmission Rate	1.43
The procedures with the largest variability deal with pneumonia, stroke, and heart failure. As expected, the standard deviation in the mortality rates and readmission rates for the same types of procedures are close. You can see that pneumonia and heart failure have higher standard deviations in both mortality and readmission rates than the other procedures.

The next measure I looked at was complications. The top five procedures with the highest standard deviation are:
Deaths among Patients with Serious Treatable Complications after Surgery        18.41
Blood stream infection after surgery	2.19
Serious blood clots after surgery	1.84
Rate of complications for hip/knee replacement patients	0.56
Pressure sores	0.49
Even though these are not technically different procedures, it is interesting to see what kind of complications have the highest variability. More extreme cases tend to have higher standard deviations. As we can see here, deaths by far has the highest variability.
